# spaceship_titanic_transportation_prediction
This is the famous kaggle competition problem of predicting the people transported to alternate dimension due to the collision spaceship titanic.

I replaced the missing values in the categorical column with the most frequent values and in the numerical columns with 0. However, I used median for Age and RoomService columns.

I used Light Gradient Boosting algorithm to get an accuracy of around 80% locally but on kaggle, it was slightly reduced.
